One day a very small shark was born and looked around at his world for the first time.
“Gosh!” he said. “It’s a big place. Where am I?”
He swam around for a bit then stopped suddenly.
Where was everyone? He realised that he was all alone.
“If I’m alone,” he said out loud, “how do I know what I am?”
“Excuuuuuuuuuuse meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee e?” said a booming voice above him.
A huge shape loomed overhead, with a huge mouth.
“Yes,” said the little shark in a very small voice.

“Yooooooou loooooooook looooooooooost. Is everything okaaaaaaaaaaaay?”

“I’m Tiny,” said the little shark, trying not to tremble. “I don’t know what I am. What are you?”
“I’m Humphrey,” said the mouth. “I’m a baaaaaaaaaaasking shaaaaaaaaaaaaaark. I bask on the surface of the sea.” “Could I be like you?” said Tiny.
“Don’t reckon so, little fella,” said Winston.
“I’m brown and you’re blue.”

“Oh,” said Tiny. “Why are you that colour?”

“So I blend in when I’m on patrol,” said Winston. “Look over there”

Tiny looked where he was pointing and saw the most beautiful garden he had ever seen.

“What is it?” he said in amazement.

“Coral reef,” said Winston.

“And it’s very precious. Life in the ocean depends on it. But fish, boats and humans come and break it and it takes hundreds of years to grow. I just lay around here on the sand guarding it.”

“Well I’m very glad you’re here,” said Tiny, “but what shall I do?”

“Head west and see what you can find,” said Winston.

“I will, and thank you.”

And the little shark swam on.
